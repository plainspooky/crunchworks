BLNKCRSR
A blinking cursor like on TRS-80 Color for MSX

TO BUILD
--------
Don't use the '--msx' option! Pasmo has a bug that sets 0x0000 as
execution address in binary files (or the documentation don't
explain how to set it).

Just type:

    $ pasmo -d -v blnkcrsr.asm blnkcrsr.bin


TO USE
------
In MSX BASIC type:

    BLOAD "BLNKCRSR.BIN",R

And in SCREEN 1 use:

    A=USR8(0)  ->  To enable blinking cursor

    A=USR9(0)  ->  To disable blinking cursor


BUGS
----
I think that this program has a lot of bugs. But hust enable the
blinking in SCREEN 1.
